        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Learning HTML was my first step into the world of web development, and it completely changed how I view the internet.
            At first, it felt like learning a new language â€” filled with tags, elements, and structure.
            But as I progressed, I realized HTML is the foundation of every webpage, and mastering it gave me the power to bring my ideas to life on the screen.
            From creating simple text pages to building structured layouts with images, links, and forms, every step made me more confident.
            It was both fun and empowering to write code and see instant results in the browser. 
            HTML taught me the basics of how websites work and sparked my curiosity to explore CSS, JavaScript, and beyond.

        <h2>Why HTML is important?</h2>
        <p>
            HTML is important because it forms the foundation of all web pages. 
            It structures content, allowing browsers to display text, images, links, and other elements.
            Without HTML, websites wouldn't function. It's essential for creating user-friendly, accessible, and interactive web experiences, making it a key skill in web development.

            Save the file with a .html extension and open it in a browser to see your first webpage come to life. Practice builds confidence!
